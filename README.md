</details>

-   I learned about what is the DOM and how to select items from it.
-   There are tons of methods and values in Web API.
-   It was very usefull information about perfomance.

### Practical task

[demo](https://alstep07.github.io/task-js-dom/) | [Code Base](https://github.com/alstep07/alstep07.github.io/tree/master/task-js-dom)

-   Theory is good, but practice is better!
-   It is hard when your code doesn't work, but it is the best way to learn.

## Building a Tiny JS World

[demo](https://alstep07.github.io/a-tiny-JS-world/) | [Code Base](https://github.com/alstep07/a-tiny-JS-world/blob/populate-world/index.js)

-   This tiny exercise is very usefull for a start.
-   I want to learn more about object-oriented programming in the next tasks.

## Object Oriented JS

<details>
    <summary>Udacity course</summary>

</details>

-   With this course and extra materials i learned about prototypes and delegation.
-   This is a very difficult topic as for me, but it is very important to learn.
-   I intend to use OOP principles in future.

## OOP exercise

[demo](https://alstep07.github.io/a-tiny-JS-world/) | [Code Base](https://github.com/alstep07/a-tiny-JS-world/blob/master/index.js)

- I saw the difference between my first method and OOP principles.
- If you have to build a big world or some other big structure you should use OOP.

- Unfortunately I could not start the application to try new technologies myself.
- But anyway I got acquainted with Service Worker and Indexed DB.
- To use this technologies in future I should learn it more thoroughly and try in practice.

## Memory Pair Game

> waiting for review.

## Website Performance Optimization

> I will return to this task after finishing required practice.

## Friends App

[demo](https://alstep07.github.io/friends-app/) | [Code Base](https://github.com/alstep07/friends-app)

- Through this task I got acquainted with async JS (but it's still difficult topic and I need more knowledge).
- I was interesting to work with different array methods to sort and filter a data.
- It was very usefull task and I will learn more about promises and async/awaits.
